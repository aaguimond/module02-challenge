## Purpose

This project is a part of my education for Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp. Our objective was to create a live URL to host our continuously growing portfolios.

## Technologies Used

This project was completed using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/about), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Git Hub](https://github.com/).

### HTML Elements

In this project we utilized semantic HTML elements. This portfolio page also uses image wrappers to better showcase my completed projects. These allowed me to provide interactive CSS style to the projects while also keeping them looking clean.
