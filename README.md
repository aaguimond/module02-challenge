## Purpose

This project is a part of my education for Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp. Our objective was to create a live URL to host our continuously growing portfolios.

## Technologies Used

This project was completed using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/about), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Git Hub](https://github.com/).

### HTML Elements

In this project we utilized semantic HTML elements. This portfolio page also uses image wrappers to better showcase my completed projects. These allowed me to provide interactive CSS style to the projects while also keeping them looking clean. A short but comprehensive list of the sections and how they are structured is below:
* Body
    * Header
        * Title
        * Navigation bar
    * Projects section
        * Project 1
        * Project 2, etc.
    * Aside
        * About
            * Bio
            * Portrait
        * Contact
            * Links to contact
    * Footer
        * Copyright

We also have anchor links within the sticky navigation bar that lead to each section within the page. As the nav bar is always visible, these anchor links provide much needed ease of access to the site, especially as it will continue to grow.

Each project section links to its completed project on an external webpage. There are also links to email me and to my external GitHub site within the 'Contact' section at the bottom of the page.

As I'm still relatively early into my web development education, I have had to temporarily add a placeholder project. I will be actively working on this page for the foreseeable future, and as such, there will be further edits and improvements to the HTML and other elements within the page.

### CSS Elements

This portfolio site uses some neat CSS that I'm proud of. Some of it is listed below:
* A sticky navigation bar
* Image wrappers that transition from partial to full opacity upon being hovered over
* Links that glow upon being hovered over
* Images that dynamically scale to the size of the webpage, eliminating the need to scroll horizontally and enabling the page to efficiently use all space available to it
* Drop shadows that give each box on the page depth
* Media queries that enable the page to dynamically shift its layout depending on the size of the viewport viewing the page

### Javascript

There is currently no Javascript being used, but I plan to add some in the near future. As such, there is an empty Javascript file included in this project. This will be updated as I continue to add to this portfolio site.
